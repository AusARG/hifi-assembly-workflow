# HiFi *de novo* genome assembly workflow

HiFi-assembly-workflow is a bioinformatics pipeline that can be used to analyse Pacbio CCS reads for *de novo* genome assembly using PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS)  reads. This workflow is implemented in Nextflow and has 3 major sections. 
 
Please refer to the following documentation for detailed description of each workflow section:
 
- Pre-assembly quality control (QC)
- Assembly 
- Post-assembly QC
